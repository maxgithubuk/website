  <h1>Biography</h1>

  <p>I hold a PhD in Clinical Research from the Department of Clinical, Educational, and Health Psychology at University College London (UCL), and an MSc in Psychological Sciences from UCL’s Division of Psychology and Language Sciences.</p>

  <p>My research is grounded in a commitment to methodological pluralism, integrating idiographic and nomothetic approaches through both qualitative and quantitative methods. As such, I am particularly passionate about mixed-methods research, and have applied interviews, focus groups, and other qualitative tools alongside classical and advanced statistical techniques to investigate complex questions in mental health and human development.</p>

  <p>I take a critical stance toward dominant paradigms in mental health care, particularly the reification of heuristic constructs into fixed diagnostic nosologies—often deployed in ways that serve systemic or institutional interests more than those of the patient. In the words of the inimitable Herman Melville:</p>

  <blockquote>
    “Who in the rainbow can draw the line where the violet tint ends and the orange tint begins? Distinctly we see the difference of the colors, but where exactly does the one first blendingly enter into the other? So with sanity and insanity. In pronounced cases there is no question about them. But in some supposed cases, in various degrees supposedly less pronounced, to draw the exact line of demarkation few will undertake tho’ for a fee some professional experts will. There is nothing namable but that some men will undertake to do it for pay.”
    <cite>— Billy Budd, Chapter 21</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This scepticism extends to aspects of psychological science, where crude, unstable, and poorly validated psychometric measures and behavioural have too often been used to make broad claims about human cognition, emotion, and behaviour. The open science movement has begun to offer a necessary corrective, and I strongly support the demand for better quality research methodologies and the calling out of questionable research practices. In the naked light, time will tell about the fate and predictive capacity of Psychology as a science as we know it. .</p>

  <p>To truly apprehend the gestalt of human subjectivity and behaviour, we must pursue research that holds individual complexity and generalisable patterns in productive tension. I am excited by opportunities—academic or commercial—that are committed to this integrative vision.</p>
